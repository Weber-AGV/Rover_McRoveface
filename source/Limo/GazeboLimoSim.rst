This window will allow you to control the movement of the robot using ackermann_steering_controller. The vertical bar acts as the forward, backwards movement needed to boost the robot into motion, while the horizontal bar controls the direction the robot accelerates in. Zoom in on the Hunter and play around with the controlls!
