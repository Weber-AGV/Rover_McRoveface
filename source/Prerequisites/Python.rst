Python
==============

Python3 is a high-level programming language used by many developers and software such as ROS. It is designed to be extreamly readable and easy to learn. There are many places to learn Python3 skills online including the python `documentation website <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_. For this guide, we will folcus only on the bare essentials needed.


Install Python3

Instal Python3 with the following command in the Terminal

.. code-block:: text

	sudo apt install python3

You should be able to see your newly installed python by executing the following command.

Create Python3 File
----------------------------

A simple way to create a new python file is to open up any text editor. Simply save the file in the wanted folder with a name, and followed by the .py extentson. The computer will then recognize it as a python file. Other ways of creating a python file are through the terminal, using VIM or the touch command. These are slightly more complicated methods for beginners, so we suggest staying away from terminal file creation.
