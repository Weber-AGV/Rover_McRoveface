the Robot Operating System (ROS) is a software built for robot applications. Built in 2007, ROS goal is to provide a standard for robotic applications that developers can use for any robot. The software makes it easy to manage the many different components of a robot, including sensors, camera, motion planing, driver, joystick, and helps them communicate between eachother. Ros also provides the developer with many premade libraries that make future projects far quicker and easier.
