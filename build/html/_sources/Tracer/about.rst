About Tracer
========================

Tracer, as a two-wheeled differential AGV, has unique advantages in the field of indoor transportation. The small and flexible structure enables it to freely shuttle in various indoor environments. Its single handling efficiency has great advantages due to the high bearing capacity in combination of the strong power. Provided with the sensing system, it even operates more autonomously. As Tracer features low cost, high efficiency and fast deployment, it is the king of transportation scenarios. Furthermore, the flat design of the body brings extreme bearing capacity. The two-wheel drive puts the universal wheels in motion, which can realize differential rotation and free shuttle in the indoor environment. It is additionally equipped with swing arm independent suspension which leads to easy surmounting of small obstacles. 


Development
----------------------------

The Tracer can be adapted to lightweight operation mode. Users can communicate with the main control through CAN bus protocol, and the open source SDK and ROS_PACKAGE are also provided.
