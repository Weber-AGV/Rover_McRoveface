TRACER is an AgileX robot with a two-wheel differential AGV. It has unique advantages in the field of indoor transportation. Its small and flexible structure enables it to freely shuttle in various indoor environments. Its single handling efficiency has great advantages due to the high bearing capacity in combination of the strong power. Provided with the sensing system, it even operates more autonomously.
