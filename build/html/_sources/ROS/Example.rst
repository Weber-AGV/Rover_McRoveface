Example
==============

We will be creating our first ROS program in this example. To do this, we will first create a workspace to create our python code in. Then we will handle ROS packages and ROS nodes to develop a working ROS program.


*Create a Catkin Workspace*
------------------------------

Catkin is the official build system for ROS. You will use it everytime you need to build your ROS application.

To create a Catkin workspace please make sure you are in your home directory, or the directory that you choose to create your ROS program. Create a new directory (We recomend naming the directory catkin_ws). You also want to create a src folder inside you're newly created catkin folder.

Inside the catkin directory, execute the command 'catkin_make'. This will build you a new ROS work environment. 

Now if you list all inside the catkin directory (using ls), you should see the created 'src' folder, a 'build' folder, and a 'devel' folder
