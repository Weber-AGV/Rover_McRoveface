The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a software built for robot applications. Built in 2007, ROS goal is to provide a standard for robotic applications that developers can use for any robot. The software makes it easy to manage the many different components of a robot, including sensors, camera, motion planning, driver, joystick, and helps them communicate between each other. Ros also provides the developer with many premade libraries that make future projects far quicker and easier.
